# CS 1010 12 Group # 1 GUI Project Jayden Luong
# This project is a functional music player that takes mp3 files from the user through the file folder. After the user selects their songs the list should appear on the music player. To play the mp3 file, you click the play button, to pause you click the pause button. While the music player is running, the user also has the option to skip or go back to the previous song and even a shuffle button to randomize the songs. In addition to this, there are multiple sliders that control either the volume of the music player or the timestamp of the song.

# There are multiple packages that the user will have to download, this includes pygame to run the lists of the music player and allows the user to load and play the loaded mp3 files. The user will also have to install customtkinter for the sliders to work, this includes the volume and time bar. The last package that you will need installed is the mutagen package, this package is installed in order to get the length of the song for the sliders to work properly.

# To install these packages, go into the command prompt and then input the following

# pip install pygame

# pip install customtkinter

# pip install mutagen
